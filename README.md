# Stock-Analysis

## Overview of Project

This project's goal is to explore and analyze different green energy stocks for investors who wish to diversify their funds. To perform this data analysis, we used VBA to write code that will automate this analysis.  We found the total daily volume and yearly return for each stock, while one of the green energy stocks that our client was most interested in was Daqo’s Stock (DQ). In order to best advice our investor we will perform an analysis specifically to the DQ stocks to compare its performance against the performance of another top 12 green energy stocks.

## Results 
After automating our code through VBA, our outcomes are shown in the following tables:

These two tables portray the performance of these stocks for the years of 2017, and 2018. The values shadowed in green represent the an increase in performance or a positive return, while the values shadowed in read represent the stocks that had a negative return. 

Among these results, we have also provided our investor with a script and a timer that will calculate how long the code takes to execute while performing this calculations. The timers indicated the following:

## Summary

When making a comparison with these outcomes, we can see that DQ along with AY, CSIQ, FSLR, HASI, JKS, SEDG, SPWR, TERP, and VSLR had a decrease in value for its Return in price from the beginning of the year to the end of the year. Leaving ENPH, and RUN with an increase in value for their yearly Return. We can also see that the Total Daily Volume for these performers (ENPH, RUN) had increased by 36.51% and 53.24% respectively. Finally, we can speculate that these two top green energy stocks ENPH & RUN are worth exploring further to make a knowleadgble decision and potentially invest in them. While DQ’s Total Daily Volume had increased by 33.18%, its Return was devalued by 62.6% which as considerate amount of loss.
